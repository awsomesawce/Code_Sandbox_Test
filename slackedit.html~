<ul>
<li>Alternative to OneNote, <a href="https://keep.google.com">Google Keep</a>, Microsoft ToDo, crossnote.app, GitBook,</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="differences-between-onenote-crossnote.app-and-slackedit--also-hackmd">Differences between OneNote, Crossnote.app and SlackEdit &gt; also HackMD</h3>
<p>OneNote and crossnote.app have the ability to add tags to sections of notes to essentially set bookmarks that you can refer back to later.  Say if you are looking for information that is spread around between notes and pages, you can search for a tag and get information relating to that tag.  SlackEdit seems to not have that ability due to the lack of a search bar.</p>
<h2 id="onenote-can-do-a-few-things-slackedit-cant-do"><strong>OneNote</strong> can do a few things SlackEdit can’t do</h2>
<ul>
<li>Organization is accomplished by dividing notes into pages, pages into sections, and sections into Notebooks.  You can create multiple of each element.  SlackEdit has a similar process in which notes can be divided amongst folders and workspaces.  Workspaces are tied to other online services including Google Drive, GitHub, GitLab, CouchDB, and others.</li>
<li>OneNote isn’t <em>text-only</em>.  Users can input drawings and other media into their notes</li>
<li>Both OneNote and SlackEdit have a Rich Text Formatting Toolbar at the top</li>
<li>SlackEdit can <strong>publish</strong> your markdown syntax as rich text to blogging platforms like <a href="https://blogger.com">Blogger</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a>, and others!  This feature is a huge plus when weighing the pros and cons between the note-taking apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>SlackEdit can organize notes in a few different ways, but the main function I’m missing is to search <em>within</em> notes like OneNote can do.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>! - Notes that are published to various sites have a cool little icon that represents each service it has been published to!  <em>That is sooo useful!!</em></p>
