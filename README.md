# Code_Sandbox_Test
Created with CodeSandbox

This is mainly a test on how CodeSandbox works with GitHub, but I've been putting more and more work into it so I should Fork it and make this one a template.

### This is a very basic page ###

I plan on making this a template, but for some reason I'm having trouble doing so.  If I make it a template, that's great, but I can still edit it using this sandbox.

#### Also, when I open up this sandbox, on the left sidebar there seems to be a "dependencies" menu that disapppears once the app is fully rendered

*That's bull$#!%.*

Why can't I add dependencies in an easy way like you can on other sandbox websites?.

## What do I plan on doing with this project?

A few things

* I'd like to make an entire site and develop my own CSS layouts and Bootstrap templates.
* I'd like to fully develop this site online only.  I won't be cloning the repository to my local computer and editing from there.  This will require me to really get a handle on how this webapp works.
* Import extra files that are present in HTML boilerplate into this repo.  [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) includes all the files needed to make your site more secure and functional.  I'd like to create 2 more pages that demonstrate my ability to create new layouts on each page using separate CSS files for each, but having a main.css file that declares certain rules that apply to every site, whether that be a nice sidebar or navbar, or something of that nature.  Modals even..
