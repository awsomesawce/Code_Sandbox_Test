# This is the readme for my gh-pages branch
**This site is a work in progress**
I may or may not merge this branch with the master branch as I have no idea what that will entail
Right now, I'm just excited I have a working deployed site that's fully customizable and uses **Jekyll** as it's SSG. 
It's a fully markdown-driven site.

## Master branch
I have a whole different set of files located on my Master branch, and if I merge this branch with that branch, what will that do?  Can I just keep this in it's own branch?
What are the pros and cons of doing so?  
I'm assuming that's the way it works, GitHub Pages implements a Jekyll setup on it's own branch, then you make a pull request with the master branch and compare the two branches.
That's gonna mean that all the files in the gh-pages branch will be in the same directory as the master branch.  
I'm not sure why GitHub doesn't just establish the site in the master branch...

Anyway more to come, I'm in development mode now.
