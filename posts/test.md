This is a test so I can create a posts folder to integrate with StackEdit.

## I just found out: it doesn't matter where I push from!
***StackEdit will automatically push AND pull from the /posts folder in the repository!!***
The only thing I"m unsure of is why I couldn't create a folder in the branch
