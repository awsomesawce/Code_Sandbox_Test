This is a test so I can create a posts folder to integrate with StackEdit.

## I just found out: it doesn't matter where I push from!
***StackEdit will automatically push AND pull from the /posts folder in the repository!!***
The only thing I"m unsure of is why I couldn't create a folder in the branch while using the website.  I couldn't find an option to do so. 

**But I did it by using my brain!**
I already had a clone of the repo on my pc, so I switched to the gh-pages branch, created a folder...but creating the folder *alone* didn't create the folder on the repo.  It had to have a file in it before it was recognized by github as something it should sync.
So I created this test file, commited it, pushed it, and **THEN** the folder showed up.
Now I have a fully-synced **StackEdit** workspace that automatically syncs with where it was established (/posts).  So I have two options to write posts on my Jekyll site!  Well, really there are dozens of options, but I'm trying to find the most streamlined way to do so.
I have now created my own
