## CodeSandbox.io Integration
So I wasn't able to integrate back into codesandbox because I messed with the template on *sandboxconfig.json*.  I set the template to "none" and it did not compute.  So I had to go ahead and create a new Vanilla sandbox, create a sandboxconfig.json file there and copy the settings.  It then worked, and now it's connected.  
The problem is, I want it to have it's own branch instead of work off master.  Actually the more I think about it the more it makes less sense to create ANOTHER branch.  It's just me right now, so there's no need for another branch.  Even the local branch is more than enough.  I just like to see the highlighted changes to each file.

The advantages of having codesandbox have it's own branch is...well...not much...as long as I keep track of my commits using either environment.

Now though, I can use CodeSandbox's parcel feature to add dependencies.  I believe that works just the same as adding remote css links and script links onto the page itself.
