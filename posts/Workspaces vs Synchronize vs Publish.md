# StackEdit's Many Options for Publishing MD docs

With [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io), one can publish their notes/posts/writings in many different ways.  
The first way is to initiate a *workspace*.  

## Workspaces
This option is good if you want to work with a specific destination of your files, for example publishing to a Jekyll blog hosted on a GitHub repository, or even to a specific folder in a repository.
StackEdit doesn't require you to add a workspace.  By default, it stores your notes in browser storage, so it's all local unless you set up a workspace.
You can set up a workspace 5 different ways:
* **GoogleDrive** - *by default will store in your appdata folder*
* **CouchDB**
* **GitHub** - links your workspace to a repository/branch/folder of your choice
* **GitLab** - much of the same

Any number of workspaces can be created.  For example you can have multiple GoogleDrive workspaces.  The first one will by default just lead to your invisible **AppData** folder, but you can create a GoogleDrive workspace to sync with a specific folder if you want.
I currently have **4** workspaces.  Why so many?  Mostly because I'm testing out it's functionality.  My main one is attached to GoogleDrive, and the next 3 are attached to a GitHub repo.
You see, my goal was to link to a GitHub repository and have StackEdit push and pull my posts to a Jekyll blog, and that way I could create new posts using StackEdit's cool interface to compose!
It turns out there are many ways I could have done so.
Right now I have a workspace that's linked to my `/posts` folder on the `gh-pages` branch in my primary GitHub repo, so no matter where I create/upload my posts they will always be synced with that StackEdit workspace.
Now let me explain the other syncronization options in StackEdit.
In addition to **workspaces**, you can synchronize *individual* writings in the cloud using many different services.  They are:
* **Dropbox**
* **GitHub**
* **A GitHub Gist**
*  **Google Drive**

When you *synchronize* a file, you can do so from any workspace.  *Files from one workspace won't be accessible from another workspace unless you navigate to that workspace*
