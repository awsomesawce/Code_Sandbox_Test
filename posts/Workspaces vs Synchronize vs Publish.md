# StackEdit's Many Options for Publishing MD docs

With [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io), one can publish their notes/posts/writings in many different ways.  
The first way is to initiate a *workspace*.  
This option is good if you want to work with a specific destination of your files, for example publishing to a Jekyll blog hosted on a GitHub repository, or even to a specific folder in a repository.
StackEdit doesn't require you to add a workspace.  By default, it stores your notes in browser storage, so it's all local unless you set up a workspace.
You can set up a workspace 5 different ways:
* GoogleDrive - *by default will store in your appdata folder*
* CouchDB
* GitHub - links your workspace to a repository of your choice
* GitLab - much of the same
*
