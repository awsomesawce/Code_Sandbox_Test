# StackEdit's Many Options for Publishing MD docs

With [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io), one can publish their notes/posts/writings in many different ways.  
The first way is to initiate a *workspace*.  

## Workspaces
This option is good if you want to work with a specific destination of your files, for example publishing to a Jekyll blog hosted on a GitHub repository, or even to a specific folder in a repository.
StackEdit doesn't require you to add a workspace.  By default, it stores your notes in browser storage, so it's all local unless you set up a workspace.
You can set up a workspace 5 different ways:
* **GoogleDrive** - *by default will store in your appdata folder*
* **CouchDB**
* **GitHub** - links your workspace to a repository of your choice
* **GitLab** - much of the same
Any number of workspaces can be created.  For example you can have multiple GoogleDrive workspaces.  The first one will by default just lead to your invisible **AppData** folder, but you can create a Go
