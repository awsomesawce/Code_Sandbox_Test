# StackEdit's Many Options for Publishing MD docs

With [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io), one can publish their notes/posts/writings in many different ways.  
The first way is to initiate a *workspace*.  
This option is good if you want to work with a specific destination of your files, for example publishing to a Jekyll blog hosted on a GitHub repository, or even to a specific folder in a repository.
