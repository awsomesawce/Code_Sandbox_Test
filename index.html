        <p>Please check out the other page on this site <a href="newpage.html">HERE</a></p>
        <p style="font-size:11pt;">This is gonna be super cool!  Even when you right click the editor, it brings up pretty much the same right-click menu as VSC!  I wonder what <a href="http://vscodium.com">VSCodium</a> is like...</p>

      <p>I want to be able to <mark>assign dependencies</mark> inside a static webpage</p>
      <p>
        I want to start from a template for <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>. But I guess I'll have to
        do it the annoying way.

      </p>
      
      <section>
        <p>In <a href="http://jsfiddle.com">JSFiddle</a> for example, I can add dependencies on the fly, whether it be a CSS or JS file, a CDN delivered framework, etc.</p>
        <p>It doesn't seem like that is the case in Code Sandbox.</p>
        <article>
        <h3>I'm still learning!</h3>
        <p>There are still a lot of things I have to learn about different web technologies, and it's important to not take on more than I can handle.  I still need to up my game a little bit in CSS before I graduate to using a CSSGrid system like Bootstrap.  For instance, there's a CSSGrid template on jsFiddle which uses a bunch of techniques I've never seen before to essentially get the same result as using "col" classes in Bootstrap.</p>
          </article>

      <p>
        So ok, in order to get my site up and deployed, I can use either Netlify
        or Vercel. If I want to, I could create a Gatsby template, which I could
        then automatically deploy using Netlify or Vercel.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the question is, why would I use Gatsby straight up if I could do the
        same thing by using <a href="http://codesandbox.com">CodeSandbox</a> or
        <a href="http://stackblitz.com">Stackblitz?</a>

  <section id="lower">
    <div>Hover over me to show the p#test element
      <p id="test">Hello!</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      now I will try that again in a different div and see whether it affects the first <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
      <p id="test">Hello again!</p>
    </div>

      <h2>The advantages/disadvatages of cloud-based development environments</h2>
      <p>There are many services out there that enable you to develop and test code in the cloud.  I find that both local and cloud-based environments have their pros and cons.  One problem I've ran into is importing a github repository into <a href="http://codesandbox.io">Codesandbox.io</a></p>
      <p>I tried using the appending the github URL with "box" trick.  I appended "box" in between "github" and ".com" in the URL, clicked enter, and lo and behold, the template loaded but absolutely failed to load correctly in the preview pane.</p>
      <p>Emmet abbreviations work here in the online editor, which is nice, but a lot of other things are missing.  I tend to prefer the easy UI available in VSC and Atom, and the ability to add snippets to make it easy to type out <b>code blocks</b> that you use often.</p>
      <p>If there's a way to do that here in the cloud, that would make me more prone to use this environment.</p>
