        <p style="font-size:11pt;">This is gonna be super cool!  Even when you right click the editor, it brings up pretty much the same right-click menu as VSC!  I wonder what <a href="http://vscodium.com">VSCodium</a> is like...</p>

      <p>I want to be able to <mark>assign dependencies</mark> inside a static webpage.</p>
      <p>
        I want to start from a template for <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>. But I guess I'll have to
        do it the annoying way.<br>
        Although, my other page <b>is</b> made with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>.

      </p>
      <div class="container-flex">
        <h3>BUT here's the thing...</h3>
        <p>Code Sandbox allows for cdn-delivered dependencies...I can link the bootstrap css file in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.</p>
        <p><em>CodeSandbox</em> seems to work a bit better than <em>Stackblitz</em></p>
        <p>For instance, I can click on a link to another page inside the preview pane, and it will load!  That doesn't happen in stackblitz.</p>
        <p>For some reason when you click on a link to another page in your site in the <em>Stackblitz</em> preview pane, it just reloads <code>index.html</code>.</p>
      </div>
      
      <section>
        <p>But in <a href="http://jsfiddle.com">JSFiddle</a> for example, I can add dependencies on the fly, whether it be a CSS or JS file, a CDN delivered framework, etc.</p>
        <p>It doesn't seem like that is the case in Code Sandbox.  Stackblitz allows you to add dependencies on the fly in the sidebar.  I guess with codesandbox, if you use the static page template, the dependencies menu on the sidebar is invisible.  I wonder if there's a way to activate it...</p>

        <article>
        <div class="text-center" style="text-align: center;font-stretch:expanded; font-size: 42px;">Anyway...<h2>I'm still <em>learning</em>!</h2></div>
        <p>There are still a lot of things I have to learn about different web technologies, and it's important to not take on more than I can handle.  I still need to up my game a little bit in CSS before I graduate to using a CSSGrid system like Bootstrap.  For instance, there's a CSSGrid template on jsFiddle which uses a bunch of techniques I've never seen before to essentially get the same result as using "col" classes in Bootstrap.</p>

        So ok, in order to get my site up and deployed, I can use either Netlify
        or Vercel. If I want to, I could create a Gatsby template, which I could
        then automatically deploy using Netlify or Vercel.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the question is, why would I use Gatsby straight up if I could do the
        same thing by using <a href="http://codesandbox.com">CodeSandbox</a> or
        <a href="http://stackblitz.com">Stackblitz?</a>

  <section id="lower">
    <div>Hover over me to show the p#test element
      <p id="test">Hello!</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      now I will try that again in a different div and see whether it affects the first <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
      <p id="test">Hello again!</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>The advantages/disadvatages of cloud-based development environments</h2>
      <p>There are many services out there that enable you to develop and test code in the cloud.  I find that both local and cloud-based environments have their pros and cons.  One problem I've ran into is importing a github repository into <a href="http://codesandbox.io">Codesandbox.io</a></p>
      <p>I tried using the appending the github URL with "box" trick.  I appended "box" in between "github" and ".com" in the URL, clicked enter, and lo and behold, the template loaded but absolutely failed to load correctly in the preview pane.</p>
      <p>Emmet abbreviations work here in the online editor, which is nice, but a lot of other things are missing.  I tend to prefer the easy UI available in VSC and Atom, and the ability to add snippets to make it easy to type out <b>code blocks</b> that you use often.</p>
      <p>If there's a way to do that here in the cloud, that would make me more prone to use this environment.</p>
      <p id="test">This is a test.  But how come right there the emmet abbrs didn't work?<br>
      Also, there are two instances of me up in the top right corner... </p>
