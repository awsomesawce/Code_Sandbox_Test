# Welcome to my GitHub `gh-pages` branch!

---

This branch has been implemented as a GitHub pages site using Jekyll. 
It is synchronized to a StackEdit workspace of mine.
Check out [/posts](/posts) to read some posts!

#### When I make changes to .md files using StackEdit, it automatically commits them to the repository...but I'm having trouble.

The actual site is not updating.  Is it because I'm using StackEdit?  Is there some setting somewhere that's preventing updating the site?  The repo is being updated just fine, but when I click on the link to go to [my site](https://awsomesawce.github.io/Code_Sandbox_Test/), it still says what it said before.  At least I know that
