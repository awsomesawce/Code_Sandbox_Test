## Welcome to GitHub Pages

This branch has been automatically created by GitHub Pages.  My goal is to use **StackEdit** to automatically sync with this branch, and a folder named /posts.  This branch "gh-pages" is empty compared to the master branch.  Now I could either merge the branches together or keep gh-pages as it's own separate branch.  The <code>gh-pages</code> branch automatically builds to https://awsomesawce.github.io/code-sandbox-test/

## From Default Readme

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/awsomesawce/Code_Sandbox_Test/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/awsomesawce/Code_Sandbox_Test/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
