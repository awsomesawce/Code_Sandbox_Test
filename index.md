# Welcome to GitHub Pages

This branch has been automatically created by GitHub Pages.  My goal is to use **StackEdit** to automatically sync with this branch, and a folder named /posts.  This branch "gh-pages" is empty compared to the master branch.  Now I could either merge the branches together or keep gh-pages as it's own separate branch.  The <code>gh-pages</code> branch automatically builds to https://awsomesawce.github.io/Code_Sandbox_Test/
