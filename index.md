# Welcome to my GitHub `gh-pages` branch!

---

This branch has been implemented as a GitHub pages site using Jekyll. 
It is synchronized to a StackEdit workspace of mine.
Check out [/posts](/posts) to read some posts!

#### When I make changes to .md files using StackEdit, it automatically commits them to the repository...but I'm having trouble.

The actual site is not up
